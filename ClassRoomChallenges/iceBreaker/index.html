            <li>Pointer Finger: Someone I look up to is Russ the music artist. I look up to him because his effort and persistence made him successful.    </li>
            <li>Middle Finger: Something that really bothers me is when the people driving in front of me are going the speed limit.</li>
            <li>Ring Finger: I love to listen to music and play basketball or any other type of outdoor activity.</li>
            <li>Pinky Finger: Something I could do better is managing my time. I realized that when I started the HTML/CSS prework.  </li>
            <li>
              Thumb: If I were not in class I would probably be playing basketball with my friends or at my mom's house spending time with family.
